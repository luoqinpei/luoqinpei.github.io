Methodology</h2> <h3 id="1-frequency-shift-keying-radar"> <font size="5pt">1. Frequency Shift Keying Radar</font><br> </h3> <p>Radar systems are traditionally associated with the transmission and reception of radio frequency (RF) signals for detecting and tracking objects. FSK, in the context of radar, involves changing the frequency of the transmitted signal to convey information, which is often carried by the phase of signals.</p> <p>Let’s start from the simplest problem, if the baseband frequency is $f_{c1}$, then the transmitted signal can be expressed by, \begin{equation} S_{tx}=A_{tx}e^{j(2\pi f_{c1}t+\phi_1)}, \end{equation} where $A_{tx}$ represents the gain of the transmit antenna, and $\phi_1$ denotes the initial phase shifts introduced by the phase-lock-loop.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk_radar_flow-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk_radar_flow-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk_radar_flow-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/fsk_radar_flow.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <p>The distance between the transmit antenna and RIS can be omitted compared to the range of the object. Thus, the distance of flight can be directly expressed by $2R$. To measure the angle of the detected object, we can place two receive antennas with a very small interval $d$, and the received signals can be expressed by \begin{equation} S_{rx1}=A_{rx1}e^{j(2\pi f_{c1}t+\phi_1-\frac{4\pi f_{c1}R}{c})} \end{equation} and \begin{equation} S_{rx2}=A_{rx2}e^{j(2\pi f_{c1}t+\phi_1-\frac{4\pi f_{c1}(R+dsin\theta)}{c})}, \end{equation} in which $A_{rx1}, A_{rx2}$ represents the gain of two paths considering both the antenna gain and propagation loss. Here $\theta$ represents the azimuth angle of the object relevant to the antenna, and by the operation of multiplying conjugate, one can determine the value of it. Take the received signal $S_{rx1}$ and multiply it with the conjugate of the transmit signal, we have \begin{equation} S_{IF}=A_{rx1}A_{tx}e^{-j\frac{4\pi f_{c1}R}{c}}=Ae^{j\psi_1}, \psi_1=-\frac{4\pi f_{c1}R}{c}. \end{equation}</p> <p>One may say that with the phase information of a single-frequency wave, we can already know the range of the object. However, it is impossible in practice as it is a continuous wave and we can not locate where to start measurement. Besides, to get higher accuracy of ranging, we often choose to use frequency up to GHz, in that case, the maximum range of $\frac{c}{2f_{c1}}$ is too small to satisfy basic requirements.</p> <p>To tackle this issue, we introduce another transmit signal with a different frequency $f_{c2}$, and follow the same procedure to get the phase information $\psi_2$, then combining the two received signals we have</p> <p>\begin{equation} R=\frac{c(\psi_2-\psi_1)}{4\pi(f_{c1}-f_{c_2})}. \end{equation}</p> <p>As for the velocity, as we use two continuous waves in FSK, one can easily adopt the Doppler effect to estimate the velocity. If we assume the transmitted frequency is $f_0$, then the relation between the Doppler frequency and velocity $v$ of the target can be expressed by<d-cite key="chen2006micro"></d-cite></p> <p>\begin{equation} f_D = \frac{2f_0v}{c}. \end{equation}</p> <p>Some may ask if the target is moving, the Doppler effect will disturb the range we get from the above equations. In fact, if you insert the Doppler frequency into these functions, you will get a time-related term of $\frac{2(f_{c1}-f_{c_2})v}{c}t$, which does not affect the measurement of the phase.</p> <p>FSK radar can exhibit resilience to certain types of interference due to its inherent modulation scheme<d-cite key="wang2019spectrum"></d-cite>. It can be considered a form of spread-spectrum communication. Spread spectrum techniques involve spreading the signal energy over a wide frequency band, which can make the radar system less susceptible to narrowband interference. And by averaging multiple measurements with it, the effects of interference, which may be random or sporadic, can be reduced. This can improve the overall robustness of the radar system.</p> <p>Though FSK radar has many advantages concerning the aspect of radar, we choose this method mainly for another important reason, which will be discussed in the fourth section.</p> <h3 id="2-frequency-shift-keying-modulation"> <font size="5pt">2. Frequency Shift Keying Modulation</font><br> </h3> <p>In the last subsection, the information carried by the phase of FSK signals is well-discussed, which can be used to determine the range/angle of the object. However, apart from the phase, the amplitude of FSK signals also carries information. In traditional FSK modulation and demodulation<d-cite key="1075546"></d-cite>, it follows a pattern of time division, i.e., at one time slot the transmitter emits the frequency of $f_{c1}$ while at another time slot, it emits $f_{c2}$.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/FSK-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/FSK-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/FSK-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/FSK.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Illustration for Frequency-shift keying from <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frequency-shift_keying" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">Wikipedia</a> </div> <h3 id="3-reconfigurable-intelligent-surface"> <font size="5pt">3. Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface</font><br> </h3> <p>As a cutting-edge physical-layer technology for wireless communication, the reconfigurable intelligent surface (RIS) has the potential to further enlarge the capacity of communication systems meanwhile providing larger and more accurate sensing. It consists of numerous passive reflecting units, which can be metamaterial-based units or antennas. These units can be electronically controlled by external voltage or current, thus, it has the ability to change the amplitude and phase shifts of incident signals to create more directional beams. RIS is considered energy-efficient because it operates with passive reflecting units that do not require continuous power. This can contribute to the overall energy efficiency of wireless communication systems.</p> <div class="row justify-content-sm-center"> <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/element-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/element-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/element-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/element.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/RIS-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/RIS-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/RIS-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/RIS.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Overview of RIS (Left: Unit Design; Right: Front view) </div> <p>The unit design of RIS is shown on the left in the above figure. It has a typical structure of a three-layer metallic structure. The top layer is a metallic patch consisting of a PIN diode, which is placed on a rectangular area hollowed out from the patch. This design can increase the degree of freedom in designing the unit. The two parts of the metallic patch connected to the edges of the diode are connected to the bottom layer through vias. The middle layer is the metallic ground made of a monoblock of copper plate, which provides grounding while isolating the interference of the supply network on electromagnetic waves. The bottom layer is the metallic feedline connected to the control circuit. Through it, different bias voltages are applied to the diode to change the state of the unit. Between the metal layers, there are two layers of dielectric material (RO4350B) and one layer of bonding film (F4B), serving as the substrate for the metal layers (<a href="https://www.rogerscorp.com/advanced-electronics-solutions/ro4000-series-laminates/ro4350b-laminates" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">RO4350B</a> and <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/pulse/versatility-electrical-properties-f4b-high-frequency-materials-deng/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">F4B</a> are two special materials for high-frequency RF circuit design, click the link for more information).</p> <p>The size of each unit is $5\times 5$ mm, which means the space periodic distance $p=5mm$. It is less than half the wavelength of a 26 GHz EM wave, thus, we can realize a narrower beam with the surface. The rectangular patch structure parameters and the characteristics of the diode circuit within the topmost metal layer are the primary influencing factors on the unit surface impedance. These factors directly impact the amplitude and phase of the EM wave reflected from the unit.

To realize the ability of beam scanning required by <em>Horus</em>, the RIS-Antenna system should be designed to satisfy the following requirements:</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Requirements</th> <th>Parameters</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Operating Frequency</td> <td>25-27 GHz</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Surface Size</td> <td>$16 cm\times 16 cm$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Number of Units</td> <td>$32 \times 32$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Gain</td> <td>$&gt; 22 dBi$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Azimuth maximum angle of beam scan</td> <td>$\pm 60^{\circ}$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Elevation maximum angle of beam scan</td> <td>$\pm 10^{\circ}$</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Polarization Mode</td> <td>Linear</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/ant1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/ant2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/ant2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Left: RIS-Antenna System; Right: Geometric Sturcture </div> <p>The work process of the RIS-Antenna system can be elaborated as follows. The horn feed source located above RIS is connected to the high-frequency circuit. It transmits incident EM waves containing the signal to be transmitted to the metasurface. Each unit on the array reflects the incident waves and applies corresponding amplitude and phase changes. According to the phase modulation theory of EM wavefronts, the states of different units corresponding to different directional beams are calculated. The control circuit communicates with a host computer that alters its output, thereby applying different bias voltages to each unit to configure RIS. The reflected waves from each unit can then be superimposed in a given direction, achieving beamforming functionality.</p> <h3 id="1-phase-distribution-of-ris"> <font size="5pt">1. Phase Distribution of RIS</font><br> </h3> <p>As shown in the above figure, RIS is on the x-y plane, which is centered by $(0, y_f, z_f)$. The horn antenna can be considered as a point source, and it emits EM waves on RIS in the form of spherical waves<d-cite key="wan2016field"></d-cite>. For the unit $(m,n)$, the electric field strength of incident wave is \begin{equation} E_{m,n}^{in} = \sqrt{\frac{P_{in}}{4\pi (r_{m,n}^\prime)^2} \cdot G_{m,n} \cdot S \cdot \beta_{m,n}} \cdot exp(-jk_0 r_{m,n}^\prime) \end{equation} in which $P_{in}$ refers to the power of incident wave, $G_{m,n}$ refers to the directional coefficient of the unit $(m,n)$, and $S$ denotes the area of RIS.</p> <p>Let $\theta$ represent the elevation angle in a spherical coordinate system with the center of RIS as the sphere’s center, which is the angle between the projection of the vector on the x-z plane and the z-axis. Let $\phi$ represent the azimuthal angle in the spherical coordinate system, which is the angle between the vector in the y-z plane and the x-axis. In this case, the electric field strength of the unit in the far-field direction $(\theta, \phi)$ is given by \begin{equation} E_{m,n}(\theta, \phi) = E_{m,n}^{in} \sqrt{|\tau_{m,n}|^2 \frac{1}{2\pi(r_{m,n})^2}} \exp\left(-jk_0 r_{m,n}\right) \exp\left(j \arg(\tau_{m,n})\right) \end{equation} Where $\tau_{m,n}$ represents the reflection coefficient of the unit. To maximize the radiation intensity of the metasurface in a given beam direction, ideally, the reflection phase of each unit is given by \begin{equation} \arg(\tau_{m,n}) = k_0 r_{m,n}^{\prime} - k_0 r_{m,n} \end{equation} Due to the discrete nature of the unit states, it is not always possible to achieve the maximum radiation intensity. The selection of unit states is aimed at making the reflection phase as close as possible to the ideal reflection phase.</p> <h3 id="2-design-of-the-macrocell"> <font size="5pt">2. Design of the Macrocell</font><br> </h3> <p>In practical application, when the size of RIS is too large, it is often hard to design the control circuit to configure all the units with a very high speed. Intuitively, the units that are adjacent to each other shows very similar configuration. Thus, we can combine these units into a <strong>Macrocell</strong> to configure them with the same signal from the control circuit.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/mc1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/mc2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/mc3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc4-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc4-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/mc4-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/mc4.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div align="center"> <font size="1.5pt"> Main lobe $\theta=0^\circ$, E-plane patterns under different macrocell sizes (Top-Down, Left-Right:(a)$1\times 1$ (b)$1\times 2$ (c)$2\times 1$ (d)$2\times 2$) </font> </div> <p>In the above figures, the blue and yellow colors of each unit indicate its state of “0” and “1” respectively.

The gains of sizes $1\times 2$ and $2\times 1$ are 24.81 dBi and 25.77 dBi. The reason is that in order to avoid the feed source obstructing the EM wave, it is placed on the y-z plane and away from the z-axis. Thus, the incident wave has a wider range of phase shifts along the y-axis. Compared to the other, $2\times 1$ macrocell can provide a larger resolution along the y-axis and a smaller error of phase compensation.

On the contrary, when the size comes to $2\times 1$ and $2\times 2$, the antenna exhibits noticeable side lobes at a beam scanning angle of $30^\circ$. For a reflective array antenna, as the beam pointing angle increases, the main lobe gain decreases. However, because the side lobes, the gain of $2\times 1$ macrocell at $30^\circ$ is even lower than $1\times 2$ macrocell at $60^\circ$. The occurrence of side lobes is attributed to the correlation between the unit’s horizontal scanning angle and the phase modulation accuracy in the x-axis. Due to the adoption of a macrocell design, the increase in phase compensation error in the x-axis for the $2\times 1$ macrocell results in decreased gain and the generation of side lobes. In our design for <em>Horus</em>, we aim for an antenna system that has a larger range of azimuth angle scanning. Thus, considering both antenna gain and beam scanning range comprehensively, we choose to use the macrocell size of $1\times 2$.</p> <h3 id="3-position-of-the-feed-source"> <font size="5pt">3.

At this point, the antenna’s main polarization direction aligns with the feed source’s polarization direction, parallel to the x-axis.

It is observed that the antenna achieves its maximum gain at the center frequency of 26GHz. At 25.4GHz and 26.6GHz, there is a slight decrease in gain. The reason for this is that the designed RIS unit approaches a phase difference close to 180 degrees between the cutoff and conductive states of the diode at 26GHz. At this point, the RIS unit exhibits the best phase modulation performance. As the frequency changes, the phase difference of the unit gradually deviates from 180 degrees. When compensating for phase errors in electromagnetic wavefront modulation, this leads to an increase in phase compensation errors, resulting in a decrease in gain.</p> <p>Due to the antenna’s bandwidth performance being primarily influenced by the unit bandwidth, and the designed metasurface unit achieving good reflectance amplitude and phase across the range of 25 GHz to 27 GHz, the designed antenna exhibits minimal variation in gain over its operational bandwidth. This makes it suitable for application in broadband systems.</p> <h4 id="3-beam-scanning-ability">(3) Beam Scanning Ability</h4> <p>Finally, an analysis of the beam scanning capability of the designed system is conducted. Beam scanning includes both horizontal and vertical directions. In the horizontal direction, it refers to the angle between the projection of the main lobe beam on the x-z plane and the z-axis. In the vertical direction, it refers to the angle between the projection of the main lobe beam on the y-z plane and the z-axis. As shown in the below figures, simulations of the antenna’s far-field radiation patterns for different beam directions indicate that the antenna can accurately achieve beam pointing within a horizontal scanning range of 60 degrees and a vertical scanning range of 10 degrees, without being affected by side lobes.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az10-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az10-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az10-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/az10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az30-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az30-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az30-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/az30.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az60-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az60-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/az60-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/az60.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/el10-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/el10-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/el10-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/el10.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div align="center"> <font size="1.5pt"> Different far-field radiation patterns of the antenna under various beam directions (Top-Down, Left-Right:(a)Azimuth 10 deg (b)Azimuth 30 deg (c)Azimuth 60 deg (d)Elevation 10 deg) </font> </div> <p>For the azimuth direction, as the scanning angle increases, the pointing error of the beam increases but remains generally less than 1.5 degrees. This allows for accurate beam pointing. The main lobe gain decreases with the angle increase, and simultaneously, the level of the first side lobe increases. Within the azimuth scanning range, the gain variation is less than 4dB. Due to the design using a $1\times 2$ macrocell, there is a larger phase compensation error in the elevation direction, resulting in lower antenna gain within the elevation scanning range. In addition, the main lobe beamwidth increases with the scanning angle, and within a scanning range of 30 degrees, the beamwidth remains less than 5 degrees. Overall, the designed RIS-Antenna can achieve a maximum scanning angle of 60 degrees in the azimuth direction and 10 degrees in the elevation direction, demonstrating good pointing accuracy and main lobe gain. This meets the requirements for subsequent system design for <em>Horus</em>.</p> <table> <thead> <tr> <th>Scan angle</th> <th>Actual Direction</th> <th>Gain(dBi)</th> <th>SLL(dB)</th> <th>Beam width</th> </tr> </thead> <tbody> <tr> <td>Az 0</td> <td>-0.2</td> <td>22.73</td> <td>-15.3</td> <td>3.8</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Az 10</td> <td>9.8</td> <td>22.25</td> <td>-13.8</td> <td>3.9</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Az 30</td> <td>29.5</td> <td>20.94</td> <td>-13.9</td> <td>4.3</td> </tr> <tr> <td>Az 60</td> <td>58.7</td> <td>18.28</td> <td>-12.4</td> <td>7.1</td> </tr> <tr> <td>El 10</td> <td>10.1</td> <td>20.18</td> <td>-8.0</td> <td>4.2</td> </tr> </tbody> </table> <h3 id="5-control-circuit-design"> <font size="5pt">5.

As shown in the above figure, the RIS we design consists of $32\times 32$ units, and the macrocell size is $1\times 2$, with 2 kinds of states of each macrocell. A control circuit equipped with an FPGA processes encoding sequences from the PC and converts them into voltage signals at the corresponding output ports of the control circuit. These signals are then output to the respective units in the RIS array, achieving dynamic configuration of the reflective phase of the RIS array.</p> <h4 id="1-control-circuit">(1) Control Circuit</h4> <p>The control circuit mainly consists of a register chip, sub-circuits, input interfaces, and output interfaces. The control circuit converts encoding signals from the FPGA into voltage signals output to the RIS units.</p> <p>The circuit implements group control, where each group has multiple sub-circuits equipped with one shift register to save the number of IO ports. Considering the need for strong stability and sensitivity of register chips, shift register chips with internal TTL structure are used. This chip has one serial data input, eight parallel data outputs, one shift clock input, one latch clock input, and one power supply port. The high-level voltage of the parallel output of the register can follow the VR power supply voltage changes, providing adjustable output capability.</p> <p>The sub-circuit is composed of transistors and voltage divider resistors. Due to the limited driving capability of the shift register chip caused by its energy consumption constraints, transistors are placed to introduce an external bias voltage VCC to enhance the driving capability of the register.</p> <h4 id="2-fpga">(2) FPGA</h4> <p>The design utilizes an FPGA chip (Cyclone @ EP4CE10F17C8) responsible for receiving all commands sent by the computer under the influence of a common system clock (CLK) signal. Considering the need for a balance between high transfer speed and low error rate, a CLK frequency of 1MHz is employed, and the baud rate for serial data reception is set at 9600 bits/s. The ideal switching time for the PIN diode theoretically is 10μs. The internal program of the FPGA is written in Verilog. The FPGA receives the encoded commands from the computer through a serial reception module and outputs them to the input interface of the control circuit in a serial manner. On the FPGA, this manifests as IO interface outputs corresponding high or low-level signals. Binary ‘1’ outputs a high level, while binary ‘0’ outputs a low level. Additionally, the FPGA generates the required shift clock signal and latch clock signal for the register chip of the control circuit. To mitigate high-frequency crosstalk along the line from the FPGA output IO interface to the input interface of the sub-circuit array board, a 16-fold division of the system clock is applied to produce a 62.5kHz shift clock signal for data transmission.</p> <h4 id="3-power-supply">(3) Power Supply</h4> <p>To provide power to the entire control circuit, it is necessary to design a layer for a voltage regulation module. Due to the large scale of the control circuit, with multiple output ports, the current may be very large, requiring multiple voltage regulation modules to share the load. The sub-circuit array is divided into four regions, with each region powered by one voltage regulation module supplying power to the collector of transistors in the sub-circuit. Another voltage regulation module is used to power 64 register chips. The power supply VCC for the sub-circuit is 5V, and the power supply VR for the register chips is 3.3V.</p> <h2 id="iv-system-design-of-horus">IV.

We choose to simultaneously transmit signals with two frequencies but with different amplitudes. For example, if we want to transmit the bit “1”, we set the amplitude of the signal with frequency $f_{c1}$ as 1 and the signal with frequency $f_{c2}$ as 0.1, while for bit “0” is vice versa. The aggregate signal will be transmitted, the radar receiver will still be able to identify the phase difference to get the location of the object, while the receiver deployed on the vehicle can just follow the basic FSK demodulation scheme to get the information transmitted from <em>Horus</em>.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/fsk2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/fsk1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/fsk1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Comparison of two different modulation schemes (Left: Classical FSK; Right: FSK for ISAC in Horus) </div> <p>Some may argue that EM waves of different frequencies may experience different paths and corresponding losses when propagating in a medium. Therefore, if information is transmitted based on their amplitudes, it could be severely disrupted. For example, a wave with a relative amplitude of 1 may suffer greater losses, resulting in the amplitude of that frequency in the received signal being even smaller than that of a wave with a relative amplitude of 0.1 in another frequency. It can be explained by coherence bandwidth, which represents the range of frequencies over which the variations in the channel response are relatively small. Typically, the coherence bandwidth increases with the frequency. According to <d-cite key="4139232"></d-cite>, the coherence bandwidth of 11.2 GHz and 62.4 GHz at the 0.7 correlation level is 18.3 MHz and 32.8 MHz respectively. As we adopt a center frequency of 26 GHz and frequency spacing of 12 MHz, thus, we can ensure that the fading experienced by signals of these two frequencies in the air is almost identical.</p> <h3 id="3-frame-structure"> <font size="5pt">3.

In each round of radar detection <d-footnote>It refers to the period that the RIS directs the beam towards the blind area it aims to detect.</d-footnote>, the host will generate several sensing packets. The sensing packet consists of a fixed number of sampling points of the FSK signals, which is generated by adding multiple tags to divide the long sequence of sampled FSK signals. All the sampling points in each packet will be subsequently processed by downsampling, Fast Fourier Transform and peak detection to determine the range and velocity of the target.</p> <p>As for the state information, though we only have two states of <strong>IDLE</strong> and <strong>ALARM</strong>, however, using only one bit to encode it is not robust to variation of the environment. To increase the Hamming Distance between two codes, we use the concatenation of the Morse code for the words ‘IDLE’ and ‘ALARM’ as the state information<d-footnote>'IDLE' corresponds to '0010001000', 'ALARM' corresponds to '0101000101011'. To make the encoding lengths equal, we omitted the continuous three zeros in the middle of the 'ALARM' encoding, and it becomes '0101101011'.</d-footnote>. To make sure that the vehicle can receive and demodulate correct information from the host, we added a 32-bit cyclic redundancy check (CRC) code before encoding the information. Of course, at the very beginning of the entire frame, there is an access code used for link layer communication to determine the start of the information frame.</p> <p>In our system, these two frames are continuously generated simultaneously. To realize the FSK modulation we propose in the last section, the process is quite simple by using numerical operations on signals from the <em>Gnuradio</em> library. However, to achieve high accuracy in measuring the phase, we need to adopt a very high sampling rate, under which the numerical operations between two signals may be severely affected by timing error<d-cite key="dillinger2005software"></d-cite>. Thus, we choose to send the state information with a much lower baud rate by interpolating. If the baud rate is $B$, and the sampling rate is $f_s$, then we just repeat each symbol in the state information frame by $\frac{f_s}{B}$ times<d-footnote>In other words, the state information frame now includes multiple radar detection frames.</d-footnote>. In this case, even though there might be potential timing errors at the 0-1 bit transition edges in the status information frame, due to their small proportion in the entire frame sequence, the information can still be accurately transmitted.</p> <p>The whole working process of <em>Horus</em> can be partitioned into two phases: The sensing phase and the communication phase. We set a fixed number of sensing packets. In the sensing phase, <em>Horus</em> will transmit and receive that number of packets, subsequently, it will change to the communication phase. The host will configure RIS to direct the beam toward the vehicle for a fixed time interval to transmit the state information. At last, the beam will be re-directed to detect the blind area and start a new sensing phase. Note that in the whole process, if there is no change in the state information, <em>Horus</em> keeps transmitting the same signals.</p> <h3 id="4-data-synthesis"> <font size="5pt">4. Data synthesis</font><br> </h3> <p>In this section, we introduce the core data processing part of <em>Horus</em>, about how it detects, tracks the approaching target and determines whether a collision will happen.</p> <h4 id="1-moving-target-detection">(1) Moving Target Detection</h4> <p>Due to its high frequency and short wavelength, millimeter waves are prone to attenuation in the air<d-cite key="marcus2005millimeter"></d-cite>. Thus, for a typical corridor scenario, we find that if there is no object in relatively close proximity, the reflected signals are too weak to extract range or velocity information from it. In our experiments, when there is no target in the long corridor, the obtained range information fluctuates significantly. If these data are continuously used for trajectory estimation, it may lead the system to make incorrect judgments. Furthermore, performing trajectory estimation when no target is detected within the sensing range is unnecessary and a waste of computational resources. Thus, before predicting the trajectory, we need to first determine whether there is a target approaching the intersection.</p> <p>To find an appropriate feature to detect, in the experiments, we compare received signals with and without a moving object. The finding is that when there is no object in the detecting range, the velocity we get is close to zero and very stable. However, when a moving target appears within the range, the velocity will start to deviate significantly from zero. Besides, the direction of the velocity deviation from zero (i.e., positive or negative velocity) corresponds to whether the object is approaching or moving away from <em>Horus</em>. Thus, we set two thresholds of $v_{th}$ and $t_{th}$. If <em>Horus</em> gets the velocity above $v_{th}$ in at least $t_{th}$ sensing packets, then it will determine that it has detected a target approaching the intersection and start to collect the range information to infer the future trajectory of the target.</p> <h4 id="2-trajectory-estimation">(2) Trajectory Estimation</h4> <p>For directional antennas, if the side lobe level (SLL) is high, the problem of a false target or alarm may occur, which may induce abnormal data points of range or velocity<d-cite key="richards2010principles"></d-cite>. Although with RIS, our system can achieve a very narrow beam, however, when the azimuth angle is too large, the beam width as well as the side lobe level increases<d-footnote>Please refer to the performance analysis of the RIS-Antenna system in Section III.</d-footnote>. To address this issue, we attempt to smooth the motion trajectory of the target and exclude outliers. As the motion of the target is typically non-linear and includes much noise, we choose to use the method of Particle Filter to realize this goal<d-cite key="thrun2002probabilistic"></d-cite>. The number of particles in the set $N=300$. Since the time intervals between each sampling point are small, the state transition model for each particle can be well approximated as a constant velocity motion model as \begin{equation} f(x_{t,i}| x_{t-1,i})=x_{t-1,i}+v_{t-1,i}\Delta t + \epsilon_{t,i}, \end{equation} where $\epsilon_{t,i}$ is the state transition noise. For both the measurement and state transition noises, we assume they follow a Gaussian distribution, thus the measurement model of $P(z_t| x_{t,i})$ is also Gaussian as $z_t\sim \mathcal{N}(x_{t,i}, \delta_{t,i})$, where $\delta_{t,i}$ is the measurement noise.</p> <p>With a particle filter, we can predict the position of the target at the next sample time. However, this is based on the assumption that the target can be approximated as moving at a constant velocity. If we want to predict the target’s motion trajectory for a longer period in the future, this assumption no longer holds. Thus, one may try to use a longer sequence of data points to do the prediction. Yet one of the problems is how long this sequence should be. If the sequence length is too long, the model may excessively smooth some sudden behaviors, such as abrupt stops and starts, leading to larger errors in predictions. If it is too short, it may also lead to inaccurate predictions due to the limited number of samples.</p> <p>Therefore, we aim to build a model that can leverage the data from long sequences while assigning higher weights to data points that are temporally closer to the current time point. A natural idea is to use a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) network, based on recurrent neural networks, which can continually balance the relative weights of long-term and short-term memory through forget gates and input gates. However, the neural network in LSTM contains a large number of parameters, and the computational resources and time required for training and prediction pose a significant challenge for lightweight hosts to respond quickly.</p> <p>Nevertheless, we can still manage to adopt the idea of LSTM in a much simpler model. In our system, we propose a method of dynamic weighted support vector regression (DWSVR), which can be elaborated as follows:</p> <ol> <li>We maintain a First-In-First-Out (FIFO) sequence of length L at each time slot t<d-footnote>Here, t should satisfy $t\geq L$.</d-footnote>, expressed by \(Q_t=\{(x_{t-L+1}, v_{t-L+1}), \cdots, (x_t, v_t)\}\). Here $x$ and $v$ are outputs of the particle filter.</li> <li>Use the FIFO and weight vector \(\boldsymbol{w}_t\) to train a support vector regression (SVR) model. At the beginning, the weight vector is initialized as a sequence of all ones.</li> <li>Use the model to predict the trajectory \(\hat{Q}_t= \{\hat{x}_{t+1}, \cdots, \hat{x}_{t+\hat{L}}\}\) in the following $\hat{L}$ time slots.</li> <li>At time slot t+1, the FIFO becomes \(Q_t=\{(x_{t-L}, v_{t-L}), \cdots, (x_{t+1}, v_{t+1})\}\). Calculate the posterior probability of the true position of the target at time t+1 relative to the predicted position using a Gaussian model, i.e., $p(x_{t+1}||\hat{x}_{t+1})$.</li> <li>For \(w_{i,t+1} \in \boldsymbol{w}_{t+1}, t-L\leq i&lt;t+1\), it first follows a decay function of \(w_{i,t+1}=\min\{\eta w_{i+1,t}, 1\}\), where $\eta$ is the decay coefficient. Then for $w_{t+1,t+1}$, it is replaced by \(\frac{1}{p(x_{t+1}\|\hat{x}_{t+1})}\). At last, the weights are regularized by \(w_{i,t+1}=\frac{w_{i,t+1}}{\sum^L_{j=1}{w_{j,t+1}}}\)</li> </ol> <p>As shown above, the basic idea of <em>DMSVR</em> is weigh all the sampling points depending on the likelihood of the predicted and real positions of the target. If the likelihood is low, it means the performance of the prediction model is degraded. Therefore, we need to assign higher weights to those sampling points that are temporally closer to the current time. This method balances the model’s complexity and predictive performance. The figures below compare the predicted trajectory of the proposed <em>DWSVR</em> and linear regression under three different scenarios.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr1.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr2.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr3-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr3-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr3-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/dmsvr3.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Predicted trajectory under three different scenarios.

(1) Sudden Stop; (2) Sudden Acceleration. </div> <p>With the two anchors, we can get two time points of when the target will pass the intersection. As stated before, the vehicle will keep reporting its position and velocity. In our experiments, we set the vehicle to move with a constant velocity. Thus, the host can estimate the positions of the vehicle at those two time points, which form an “Alarm Area” as shown in the above figures. Once the host knows that the intersection reference point is included in this area, it determines that a collision will occur and immediately changes the state information to <strong>ALARM</strong>, meanwhile configuring RIS to direct the beam towards the vehicle. Afterward, the vehicle will choose to decelerate or stop directly to avoid the collision.</p> <p>Once the target crosses the intersection, Horus cannot detect the target in the detection area. After a period of time during which no objects can be detected, it will restore the state information to <strong>IDLE</strong> and transmit it to the vehicle in the next communication phase.</p> <h2 id="v-implementation">V. Implementation</h2> <p>In this section, we illustrate the implementation of the whole system and its working scenario. The setups of Horus and the vehicle are shown in the following two subsections respectively.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview1-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview1-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview1-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/overview1.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0" align="center"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview2-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview2-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/horus/overview2-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/horus/overview2.jpg" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Overview of the working scenario of Horus<d-footnote>The vehicle in the left figure is not deployed with a receiver.

The host connects to RIS and USRP via USB and ethernet cable respectively. The USRP model we have chosen is <a href="https://www.ettus.com/all-products/x310-kit/" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">USRP X310</a>, which has two daughterboards and independent channels, allowing simultaneous transmission and reception of signals under the same clock. We set the center frequency of USRP to 2 GHz and the baseband signals generated by the host will be modulated in it. The TX port of one daughterboard and the RX port of the other are connected to two intermediate frequency (IF) ports of the mmWave frequency converter via two low-frequency cables. The frequency converter is produced by <a href="https://www.tmytek.com/products/frequency-converters/udbox5g" rel="external nofollow noopener" target="_blank">TMYTEK</a> and it is used to up-convert the IF signal from USRP to the 26GHz frequency band and down-convert the received high-frequency signal to the IF range. The TX RF port of the frequency converter is connected to the transmitting horn antenna (feed source) through a mmWave power amplifier (PA), where the signal-to-noise ratio of the RF signal is significantly improved. The RX RF port of the frequency converter is connected to another horn antenna receiving the radar echo signals.</p> <p>Note that both RIS and PA require DC power, thus, we use two DC power supplies with output voltages of 28V and 13.59V respectively to power these two devices. The other devices in <em>Horus</em> are all powered by the standard Chinese mains electricity, which is 220V AC.</p> <h3 id="2-vehicle"> <font size="5pt">2.

Experiments</h2> <h3 id="1-transmission-at-the-transport-layer"> <font size="5pt">1. Transmission at the transport layer</font><br> </h3> <p>We first tested the compatibility of Horus with commercial network devices, during which the system status information was transmitted at the transport layer. <em>Horus</em>’s wireless network card is capable of generating a WiFi hotspot. The master computer mounted on the vehicle can directly connect to this hotspot via WiFi, placing them in the same local area network. Afterward, <em>Horus</em> can establish a socket at the transport layer using the TCP/IP protocol to directly transmit information to the vehicle. The videos below display its working process in this setting.</p> <div class="row" align="center"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/horus/horus2.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""></video> </figure> </div> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/horus/horus3.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""></video> </figure> </div> </div> <div class="caption"> Horus working at the transport layer </div> <h3 id="2-transmission-at-the-physical-layer"> <font size="5pt">2.

In the following video, due to the presence of multiple devices on the vehicle and the lack of secure mounting, we have set the vehicle speed relatively low for stability.</p> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <video src="/assets/video/horus/horus4.mp4" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" autoplay="" controls=""></video> </figure> </div> <div class="caption"> Horus working at the physical layer </div> <h2 id="vii-conclusion">VII. Conclusion</h2> <p>In this project, we propose an integrated sensing and communication system based on RIS, which can detect and track moving objects in a wide range of blind areas meanwhile transmitting information to the vehicle to avoid possible collision. The presented content above is a coarse demo, and there are many incomplete aspects in terms of functionality and design. We will keep on improving <em>Horus</em> and please stay tuned for further updates!</p> </d-article> <d-appendix> <d-footnote-list></d-footnote-list> <d-citation-list></d-citation-list> </d-appendix> <d-bibliography src="/assets/bibliography/horus.bib"></d-bibliography> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Qinpei (Sheldon) Luo.
