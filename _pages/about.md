Hello! My name is Qinpei Luo, and you can just call me Sheldon. I am a senior year undergraduate student from School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, where I am now pursuing my Bachelor's degree of Science. I am now advised by [Dr. Boya Di](https://ele.pku.edu.cn/dzxxen/info/1023/1583.htm) from School of Electronics, Peking University. My major interest lays on AI for wireless communications, including reinforcement learning, meta learning and so on. I am also interested in emerging technology in 5/6G like reconfigurable intelligent surfaces. I am looking forward to combining AI and wireless communication together in the future development of new technology of AR/VR, IoT, UAV and so on.
