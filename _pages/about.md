Hello! My name is Qinpei Luo (In Chinese: 罗钦培), and you can just call me Sheldon. I am a first year PhD student in the department of Electrical and Computer Engineering in the University of California, San Diego. I am now advised by [Dr. Xinyu Zhang](http://xyzhang.ucsd.edu). My major interest lies in mobile computing and wireless networks, especially the implementation of machine learning on these topics.

Previously, I earned my Bachelor's degree in Electronics Information Engineering from School of Electronics Engineering and Computer Science, Peking University, where I am honored to be advised by [Dr. Boya Di](https://sites.google.com/view/boya-di/homepage) from School of Electronics, Peking University.
